	"_comment": "If randomSpawnLocation is 0, then the car will be spawned at location X,Y,Z. Else if 1, a random spawn point on the map will be used. If staticCar, then the hero car will not move at all. The TX,TY,TZ represent the target location and used if not a static car, but they can miss - meaning that car will not stop at that position, same with lidarData if heroView = 0. frame_step default is 10, this means at each 10 frames you will have a new lidar and images output coming out. sensorsDisplacementDist shows how much you want to project the lidar/camera/etc sensors in front of the car from the center, going in the forward vehicle direction",
